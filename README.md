# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

This site is designed to be a small digital business card. These include a main page with a brief overview of the owner, a gallery of the individual's work and a contact form.
Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. I went with a minimalist design, but with solid features.

The contents of this portefolio are as follows;

- Three Html files : index.html, contact.html and portfolio.html.
- One CSS file: mystyles.css
- Two img files: One background. One portrait, One background.
